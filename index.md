# Synopsis

Collaborative intelligent systems are driving innovation in critical applications such as large-scale search and rescue, reconnaissance missions, and sensory networks. Despite the advantages, designing robust and scalable algorithms that require sharing information to collaborate is non-trivial, especially in decentralized settings. Learning-based methods, particularly those leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have emerged as powerful approaches for modeling multi-agent systems. GNNs enable neural networks to use graphs as a natural representation of a team and its interactions, thus capturing the inherent structure and patterns in team collaboration. Recent advances show that GNNs are transferable to new graph topologies, scalable to larger robot teams, and resilient to graph deformations.

This workshop will bring together experts, early-career researchers, and practitioners to explore the theory and practical deployment of learned representations (such as GNNs) in collaborative systems. A key focus will be bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world implementations, highlighting the successes, challenges, and opportunities. The event offers new researchers a unique opportunity to engage with cutting-edge research from experts and gain insights into real-world system deployment through invited talks and longer tutorial-style keynote sessions. Spotlight presentations, posters, and cross-disciplinary panel discussions will help establish the state-of-the-art in multi-robot representations.
